This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

1. ```npm install``` to install dependancies

2. ````npm start``` to start the application, check package json for flow and other startup commands

3. create-react-app has .envu support by itself, check this link <https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/> for more detials on create react app's environment variables. In nodejs we use dotenv package to get .env support
